Products can be created from the backend or the POS interface. To manage products from the backend,
go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Products --> Products`. Click :guilabel:`New` to create a
product, or open an existing one to edit it. Update the fields as needed and ensure the
:guilabel:`Point of Sale` checkbox is enabled at the top of the form.

To create products from the POS interface, access the POS register, click the :icon:`fa-bars`
(:guilabel:`hamburger menu`) icon, then :guilabel:`Create Product`. Enter the product details in the
pop-up window and click :guilabel:`Save`. The product is immediately available in the register.

To update an existing product from the POS register, long-click a product to open the information
pop-up, and click :guilabel:`Edit`. Change the necessary product details and click :guilabel:`Save`
to return to the POS register.

POS product categories
======================

POS product categories are used to organize products in the POS register.

To manage POS categories, follow these steps:

#. Navigate to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> PoS Product Categories`.
#. Click :guilabel:`New` to create a category or click an existing one to update it.
#. Classify and build a hierarchy between categories: Associate a category with a parent
   category by filling in the :guilabel:`Parent Category` field. A parent category groups one or
   more child categories (e.g., use `Drinks` to group `Hot beverages` and `Soft drinks`).

Once POS product categories are created, assign them to specific products:

#. Go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Products --> Products` and open a product form.
#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Point of Sale` tab and fill in the :guilabel:`Category` field with one
   or multiple POS categories.

To limit the categories displayed on the POS register, navigate to the :ref:`POS settings
<pos/use/settings>` and select the relevant categories in the :guilabel:`Restrict Categories` field
under the :guilabel:`Product & PoS categories` section.

Product combos
==============

A product combo is a bundle of multiple products sold together as a unit. Each product combo
consists of multiple categories, known as :ref:`combo choices <pos/products/combo-choices>`, and
each combo choice contains several items. When purchasing a product combo, customers can select one
or more items from each combo choice.

.. example::
    A burger menu is offered as a product combo including three combo choices: one burger, one
    drink, and one portion of fries. For each combo choice, customers select one item from the
    available options (e.g., cheeseburger or chicken burger; soda or water; regular or large fries).

Combo choice creation
---------------------

To create the combo choices that will be added to the :ref:`product combo
<pos/products/combo-creation>`, follow the next steps:

#. Go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Products --> Combo Choices` and click :guilabel:`New`.
#. Enter a name for the :guilabel:`Combo Choice`.
#. Set the maximum selectable items for the combo choice using the :guilabel:`Maximum items` field.
#. Set the number of items included in the combo choice using the :guilabel:`Includes items` field.
#. Click :guilabel:`Add a line` under the :guilabel:`Options` section to add the products that
   constitute the :guilabel:`Combo Choices`.
#. If needed, click a product to add an :guilabel:`Extra Price`.

.. admonition:: Combo Price vs. Extra Price

  The following fields determine how additional item selections are charged:

  - The :guilabel:`Combo Price` field shows the price applied to any additional product a customer
    might select (i.e., when the :guilabel:`Maximum items` field is set to `2` or higher). This
    price is automatically calculated based on the price of the least expensive product defined in
    the :guilabel:`Combo Choice`.
  - The :guilabel:`Extra Price` field is used to set an additional charge for a specific product in
    the combo choice, e.g., to cover higher costs or encourage upselling. This extra price is
    applied each time a customer selects that product within the combo choice.

Product combo creation
----------------------

#. Go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Products --> Products` and click :guilabel:`New`.
#. Enter a product name.

.. _pos/products/combo-application:

Combo application
-----------------

To apply combos, follow these steps:

#. Open the :ref:`POS register <pos/use/open-register>`.
#. Click the desired product combo, and select the preferred items for each combo choice.
#. Click :guilabel:`Add to order`.
#. Continue with the order process.

.. note::
   The total price of the product combo can change depending on the :guilabel:`Combo Price` or
   :guilabel:`Extra Price`.

.. example::
   The :guilabel:`Office Combo` costs **300** € and offers a selection of chairs and desks. The
   combo choice for chairs includes a conference chair, an office chair, and an
   armchair with a maximum selectable amount set to 2. The :guilabel:`Combo Price` for the chair
   combo choice is **35** € per added item because the conference chair is the least expensive
   product. The armchair has an :guilabel:`Extra Price` of **100** € because it is made of leather.
   Selecting the conference chair with the armchair increases the price of the :guilabel:`Office
   Combo` to **435** €. Thus, selecting the armchair adds **35** € (:guilabel:`Combo Price`) +
   **100** € (:guilabel:`Extra Price`).
